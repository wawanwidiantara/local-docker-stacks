## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Docker Stacks, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Change Default Passwords**
   - Never use the default passwords from `.env.example`
   - Generate strong passwords: `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - Use different passwords for each service

2. **Protect Environment Files**
   - Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
   - Ensure `.env` files have restricted permissions: `chmod 600 .env`
   - Keep `.env` files out of version control (already in `.gitignore`)

3. **Network Security**
   - Don't expose database ports to the internet
   - Use Docker networks to isolate services
   - Consider using a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS

4. **Keep Services Updated**
   - Regularly update to the latest stable versions
   - Monitor security advisories for the services you use
   - Rebuild containers after updating compose files

5. **Resource Limits**
   - Set memory and CPU limits to prevent DoS
   - Monitor container resource usage

6. **Backup Security**
   - Encrypt backups containing sensitive data
   - Store backups securely
   - Test backup restoration regularly

### For Local Development

Even in local development:

- Use non-default passwords
- Don't commit secrets
- Be cautious with port exposure
- Regularly clean unused volumes and containers

### For Production Use

⚠️ **Additional considerations for production:**

1. **SSL/TLS Encryption**
   - Enable SSL/TLS for all services
   - Use valid certificates
   - Configure proper cipher suites

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use strong authentication mechanisms
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Audit access logs regularly

3. **Network Isolation**
   - Use private Docker networks
   - Implement firewall rules
   - Use VPN for remote access

4. **Secrets Management**
   - Use Docker secrets or external secret management
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Audit secret access

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Enable audit logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for security events

6. **Compliance**
   - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Regular security audits
   - Document security procedures

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Where to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. **Email:** Send details to [your-security-email@example.com]
2. **Subject:** Use "SECURITY" in the subject line
3. **Include:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline:** Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: Best effort

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to fix it
- We will coordinate the disclosure timing with you

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

1. Released as soon as possible after verification
2. Announced in the CHANGELOG.md
3. Tagged with a security advisory on GitHub
4. Documented with mitigation steps

## Known Security Considerations

### Default Configurations

This project provides development-ready configurations with:

- Default passwords (must be changed)
- Exposed ports (review before production use)
- Basic security settings (enhance for production)

**These are intentional for ease of local development but MUST be hardened for production use.**

### Image Sources

All images are pulled from official sources:

- MySQL: Official Docker Hub
- PostgreSQL: Official Docker Hub  
- Redis: Official Docker Hub
- MongoDB: Official Docker Hub
- MS SQL Server: Official Microsoft MCR
- MinIO: Official MinIO

Always verify image signatures and sources before deployment.

## Compliance Notes

### Data Privacy

- Database services may store personal data
- Ensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations
- Implement appropriate data retention policies
- Use encryption at rest for sensitive data

### Audit Requirements

- Enable audit logging for compliance requirements
- Retain logs according to your compliance needs
- Implement log rotation and secure storage
